## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management. With the rise of data-driven approaches, machine learning models can play a significant role in predicting diabetes risk using patient data.

## Existing Method
Traditional methods for diabetes prediction rely on statistical analysis and clinical expertise. These methods, while valuable, may not leverage the full potential of complex data patterns present in patient records.

## Proposed method with Architecture
Our approach utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes. The architecture involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Methodology
Data Collection: Data was sourced from PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Model Selection: Evaluated multiple ML algorithms e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.
Training & Evaluation: Models were trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Implementation
The model is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
### Steps to run:
Clone this repository.
Run the notebook files to train and test the model.

## Conclusion
The developed machine learning model demonstrates promising results in predicting diabetes risk. Future work includes integrating the model into healthcare applications and improving accuracy with larger datasets.
